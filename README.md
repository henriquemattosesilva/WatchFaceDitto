If you want to do it in a new language, to write the weekdays I used the font Montserrat Semibold.

I made this WatchFace from a template. I edited the .json file and created the custom images.

# Details
At the bottom of WatchFace, there are 3 balls.
- Left Ball: When Do Not Disturb (DND) mode is enabled, the ball will turn orange;
- Middle ball: will always be white;
- Right ball: When the Mi Band is not connected to the cell phone (bluetooth), the right ball will turn blue.


# How to edit .json file
